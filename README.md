The main idea of the project is that:

*Create 3 event listeners that enable interactivity. 
*Each of the event listners should also have its own unique callback function.
*It must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. 
*The project should at least use one instance of array iteration using available
array methods(map, forEach, filter, etc)
