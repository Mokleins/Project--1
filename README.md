The main idea of the project is that:

## Project Requirements

- Create 3 event listeners that enable interactivity. 
- Each of the event listeners should also have its own unique callback function.
- It must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. 
- The project should at least use one instance of array iteration using available array methods(map, forEach, filter, etc)

## Learning Goals

- Learning how to use the dom, and select the elements
- Understanding how to fetch data 
- Using instances such as forEch, Filter, Map
- Learning how to use Event Listeners 

## Project Summary

The project will get data from `https://labs.bible.org/`. Then it will render each verse separately. 
The website will allow user insert their phone number so it can send a verse to their as a message every day.
It is important to consider that the website will have a very simple design, and it is mostly focus for people
who are interested in christian verses.

## The Final Product looks like this:
