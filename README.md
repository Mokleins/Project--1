The main idea of the project is that:

## Project Requirements

- Create 3 event listeners that enable interactivity. 
- Each of the event listeners should also have its own unique callback function.
- It must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. 
-The project should at least use one instance of array iteration using available array methods(map, forEach, filter, etc)

## Learning Goals

- Learning how to use the dom, and select the elements
- Understanding how to fetch data 
- Using instances such as forEch, Filter, Map
- Learning how to use Event Listeners
